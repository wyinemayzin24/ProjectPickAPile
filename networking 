What are the types of system model? 
o Physical models 
o Architectural models 
o Fundamental models
What is Physical model? 
Physical models are the most explicit way in which to describe a system; they capture the hardware composition of a system in terms of the computers and their interconnecting networks.
What is Architectural model? 
Architectural models describe a system in terms of the computational and communication tasks performed by its computational elements; the computational elements being individual computers or aggregates of them supported by appropriate network interconnections.
What is Fundamental model? 
Fundamental models take an abstract perspective in order to examine individual aspects of a distributed system.
	interaction models consider the structure and sequencing of the communication between the elements of the system
	failure models consider the ways in which a system may fail to operate correctly and
	security models consider how the system is protected against attempts to interfere with its correct operation or to steal its data
